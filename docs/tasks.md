# Improvement Tasks for get-cookie

This document contains a comprehensive list of actionable improvement tasks for the get-cookie project. Each task is designed to enhance the codebase, improve maintainability, or add new features.

## Code Quality and Structure

[ ] Improve incomplete JSDoc comments throughout the codebase (e.g., empty comments in FirefoxCookieQueryStrategy.ts)
[ ] Add missing examples to JSDoc comments (e.g., FirefoxCookieQueryStrategy class)
[ ] Standardize error handling across all browser implementations
[ ] Refactor duplicate code in browser-specific implementations
[ ] Implement more specific error types instead of using generic Error class
[ ] Add input validation for all public API functions
[ ] Improve type safety by reducing use of 'any' type
[ ] Update package description in package.json to reflect support for all browsers (currently only mentions Chrome)

## Testing

[ ] Increase unit test coverage for edge cases
[ ] Add integration tests for real browser environments
[ ] Implement snapshot testing for rendered cookie outputs
[ ] Add performance benchmarks for cookie extraction operations
[ ] Create more mock fixtures for consistent testing
[ ] Add tests for error conditions and recovery
[ ] Implement end-to-end tests for CLI functionality

## Documentation

[ ] Create a troubleshooting guide for common issues
[ ] Add more code examples for complex use cases
[ ] Document browser compatibility limitations
[ ] Create diagrams explaining the architecture
[ ] Add changelog automation for better release notes
[ ] Improve CLI documentation with more examples
[ ] Document security considerations when handling cookies

## Features

[ ] Add support for additional browsers (e.g., Edge, Brave)
[ ] Implement cookie modification capabilities
[ ] Add support for cookie filtering by additional criteria (e.g., secure flag, httpOnly)
[ ] Create a web interface for cookie management
[ ] Add export functionality to various formats (CSV, JSON, etc.)
[ ] Implement cookie monitoring for changes
[ ] Add support for container/profile-specific cookie extraction in Firefox

## Performance

[ ] Optimize SQLite queries for large cookie stores
[ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed cookies
[ ] Add batch processing for multiple cookie operations
[ ] Optimize binary parsing algorithms
[ ] Reduce memory usage for large cookie datasets
[ ] Implement lazy loading for browser-specific modules

## Security

[ ] Conduct a security audit of encryption/decryption methods
[ ] Implement secure storage for sensitive cookie data
[ ] Add option to redact sensitive cookie values in logs
[ ] Implement cookie value sanitization
[ ] Add warnings for insecure cookie handling practices
[ ] Create a security policy document

## Build and CI/CD

[ ] Upgrade dependencies to latest versions
[ ] Optimize build process for faster compilation
[ ] Add code coverage reporting to CI pipeline
[ ] Implement automated performance regression testing
[ ] Add cross-platform testing (Windows, Linux, macOS)
[ ] Improve release automation
[ ] Add containerization support for consistent environments

## Architecture

[ ] Refactor to support plugin architecture for custom browser implementations
[ ] Implement dependency injection for better testability
[ ] Create a more modular structure for browser-specific code
[ ] Separate CLI and library concerns more clearly
[ ] Implement a proper logging strategy with configurable levels
[ ] Add configuration system for persistent settings
[ ] Refactor to support async iterator pattern for streaming large cookie sets

## User Experience

[ ] Improve error messages with actionable information
[ ] Add progress indicators for long-running operations
[ ] Implement interactive mode for CLI
[ ] Add color coding for different cookie types in CLI output
[ ] Create a configuration wizard for first-time users
[ ] Improve help text and command suggestions
[ ] Add autocomplete support for CLI commands
